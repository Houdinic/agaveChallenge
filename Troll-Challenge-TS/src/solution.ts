/**
 * GOAL: average <1000 turns across ten tries. The best score weâ€™ve seen is 430.
 * Solution overview:
 * Building stairs around the treasure to access it. (direction of the inital 1 should be
 * facing the direction that has most blocks)
 *         7  6
 *      1  8  5
 *      2  3  4
 * 1. Move to the treasure using the shortest path
 *    a. Bring the first block bypass on the way
 * 2. find the direction with closest number of building blocks. 
 *  a. explore from treasure
 *  b. 
 * 3. while there's not enough blocks around treasure. Totol needed is (1+7)*7/2 = 28:
 *    a. find the closest blocks
 *    b. place it at the correct place
 * 
 * function: shortest path to treasure
 *  use bfs to go over the maze;
 *  each path should pick up the first encontered block
 * 
 * function: find the closest blocks
 *  Need to memorize the path to the block
 *  if !lastPlaceFetchBlock:
 *    search from the entrance of the stair around treasure
 *  else:
 *    search from the lastPlaceFetchBlock
 *    
 * 
 * function: place it at the correct place
 * use a 2D arrary to track how the blocks are placed around the treasure
 *  start point of the stair should be either right, left, up or down of the treasure
 *
